# Usage
After configuring the solution, the on-going use is quite straight forward. The system creates "Messages" which have an associated "Event". Events are defined by you and can be as granular or broad as you'd like. Messages created will be developed by you in whatever means you'd like - they are just a custom Activity CDS record. A Flow defined in the solution will be triggered and then match the Owner of the record and the associated Event to a Subscription. If one exists, the Flow will check which methods have been selected and notifies the User accordingly. Simple.

Teams support has been added where another Flow will duplicate the Team owned Message record into individual User owned records. These are then processed normally. - LP What is meant by normally?

If a user doesn't want to be informed of a specific Event, they can unsubscribe. If a user deems a specific Event as urgent, they can enable Web Push and/or Mobile methods to bypass the flood of emails they might be receiving.
