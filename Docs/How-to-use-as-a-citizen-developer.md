The interface to this framework is two custom CDS entities: Notification Event and Notification Message. 

Each Notification Message is associated to a Notification Event which is used to determine whether the Message recipient is to be notified and how. 

This interface is best utilised when Message records are automated via Flows, Workflows, Plugins, or even external API as you would when creating emails.
